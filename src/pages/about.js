            <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ashlyn</h1>
            <p>Iâ€™m passionate about building great digital products that improve peoples lives. I like to approach complicated problems and design elegant solutions.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m a digital product strategist. I find complex problems and dive straight into the heart of them. I have worked in small and large teams from New Zealand in the health, social, energy, and financial sector. I care about the products I work on, and I choose to work on products that improve peoples lives and, hopefully, make a positive environment or social impact.</p>
            <h1>Why handbooks?</h1>
            <p>Handbooks are more accessible than ebooks. Theyâ€™re like books - but designed for people who like the internet.</p>
            <p>Digital handbooks are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>easier to keep up to date and will always be more relevant,</li>
              <li>more accessible because I share them for free, and</li>
              <li>better designed for making content more accessible.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Get in touch</h1>
            <p>Do you want to have a short chat with me, or do you have any feedback on my handbooks? I work on the Wellington (GMT +13) time zone. Contact me at <a href="mailto:hey@ashlyn.app">hey@ashlyn.app</a></p>
