            <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ashlyn</h1>
            <p>Iâ€™m passionate about building great digital products that improve peoples lives. I like to approach complicated problems and design elegant solutions.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m a digital product strategist. I find complex problems and dive straight into the heart of them. I have worked in small and large teams from New Zealand in the health sector, social sector, and the financial sector.</p>
            <p>I care about the products I work on and take on work that makes a positive impact on the world either socially, environmentally, or from a governance perspective.</p>
            <h2>Why handbooks?</h2>
            <p>Handbooks are more accessible than ebooks. Theyâ€™re like books - but designed for people who like the internet.</p>
            <p>Digital handbooks are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>are easier to keep up to date and will always be more relevant,</li>
              <li>more accessible because I share them for free, and</li>
              <li>better designed for making content more accessible.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Get in touch</h1>
